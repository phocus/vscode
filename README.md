# phocus vscode theme
This is an opinionated vscode implementation of the [phocus color scheme](https://phocus.github.io/).

## Development
Clone the repository, open it in vscode, and start a debug session:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phocus/vscode phocus/vscode
code phocus/vscode
# press F5 in the opened vscode window
```
The window that opens after you pressed `F5` will automatically reload the extension whenever you save changes.

I am actively working on phocus and other cool projects on the [Desktop Makers Discord](https://discord.gg/RqKTeA4uxW). It aims to be a community for communities of Linux desktop related projects. If you are looking to collaborate with or want to contribute to great projects, this might be the right place for you.
